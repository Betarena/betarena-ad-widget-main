The Widget is fully responsive and higlhy dynamic to adjsut to any screen size and correctly display the data as outlined in the desgin-test. In line with the `Asana` Task board card, 
this widget displays data for a user on a target match-betting site in accordance to the `GeoPosition`, from which the correct `data`, `language` and `translations` are rendered into the `widget`.

The widget has been spit into to components, for easier change in the `html` code and `responsiveness` into:
- `src\components\_MobileBetarenaWidget.svelte` &,
- `src\components\_TabletPlusBetarenaWidget.svelte` (triggered at scree-width of `1024px`)

However, only the `<style> & html` code is being changed in these components, with each of the components sharing the same `<scripr>` code, stored inside `src\functions\index.ts`.

## Database

For the database, `Firebase` was used to store the necessary data of the local user location and language.

The `Firebase Realtime Database` was used, for which the following documentation was used:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database

### Firebase Structure

All of the connection and initialization of the use of Firebase on the App is stored inside the `src\firebase\index.ts`

The widget handles the response form the `GeoJS` API using the following consturcted interface, located inside the `src\models\geo-js-interface.ts` file:
